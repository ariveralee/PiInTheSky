# PiInTheSky

PiInTheSky is a security camera built using OpenCV and Raspberry Pi. The idea is to have a tracking algorithm that once is triggered by a motion sensor, notifies the user of entry into their space VIA text and/or phone call.

To implement this, you will need the following software and hardware:

### Libraries:
-OpenCV [OpenCV Site](http://opencv.org/)

### Hardware:
- Raspberry Pi 3 Model B | [Link Model B ](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01CD5VC92/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
- Raspberry Pi Camera Module V2 | [Camera Module](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01ER2SKFS/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
- Raspberry Pi case | [Official Case](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01F1PSFY6/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
- Micro SD card | (preferably with the adapter) [Samsung EVO MicroSD](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IVPU786/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
- Raspberry Pi Heatsink | [Heatsinks](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00HPQGTI4/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
- CanaKit 5V 2.5 Raspberry Pi 3 Power Supply | [Power Supply](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MARDJZ4/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1)


### Notes:
- This has not been tested on any other hardware but this does not mean that it will not work
- Heatsinks are not necessary but **highly suggested**; the Pi can get hot.
